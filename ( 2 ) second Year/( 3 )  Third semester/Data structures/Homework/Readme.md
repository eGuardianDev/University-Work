## Simulation of exam

Homework for Course - Data Structures.

Developed by Tsvetomir Staykov

---
### Development enviroment

Developed and tested on - **Linux Fedora 40**

#### compile

To compile and running on **Linux** use
```
./compile.bash
```
or
```
g++ ./src/main.cpp ./src/Implementation/*.cpp -o ./bin/a.out
 ```
check `/bin/` for compiled files

The program needs `input.txt` to run 

#### Tests
Its used the library **Catch**

To compile and running tests on **Linux** use
```
./compileTests.bash
```
check `/Tests/bin/` for compiled files 

(I don't know CMake, yet)

### Quick introduction
The project begins in `/src/main.cpp`

To compile on your own you need to to include `/src/Implementation/*.cpp`

All headers files are in `/src/Headers/`

Almost all of the implem–µntations and additional programs the code are in `/src/Implementation/`


### Algorithm for board
The algorthim starts recursion, places the person and checks if this is the best configuration. (best configuration meaning most people on board) If so it saves it. Then continues. 

After filling the board one times, It stars going back. On every step going back, It tries to find better way to fill the board by checking how much space is taken by people around them. It removes the person first placed and places on new location. If the new configuration takes less space, the recursion starts again forward again.

The problem here is that the count of space taken is saved locally in function when the recursion is called. This leads to similar configurations being checked repeatedly. Because of that **altered version** of the algorithm can be used to save count globally using vector. Scroll down to see how to activate it.

### Classes 

#### addons
Additional tools for displaying the board and global classes

#### Board 
Class used to generate boards

#### People on board
Two algorthims for finding the best way to position people in a exam hall. In the implementation folder show two algorithms than can be switched using

```// #define _Using_Altered_Algorithm```
Removing the comments will let the compile use the **altered version**



#### Student queue
Used for sorting who enters the fall depeneding on specific time

#### TakingTestList
Used for checking if people finished the exam

#### Main logic
Loading the data from file, running the algorithms for letting people in, removing them when they are done and checking their work.



### What I learned from this homework
Asserts were very useful for funding problems early on. 

Tests helped me see a few minor bugs. 

Queues return default value if empty and don't throw exceptions
