# Sensors exercises

## MQ2
 quick description: when flamable gas is present, the conductivity of the sensor increases

 - detects: LPG, i-butane, propane, methane ,alcohol, hydrogen, smoke.
 - SnO2 - gas sensing layer
## MQ3
 
 - detects (high sensitivity): Alcohol
 - detects (small sensitivity): Benzine

 - SnO2 - gas sensing layer

 - uses temperature and humidity sensor for more accurate assement of values

## MQ 5
 - detects: LPG, natural gas, town gas ( high sensitivity )
 -   avoid: the noise of alcohol, cooking fumes and cigarette smoke (small sensitivity )
 - SnO2 - gas sensing layer


## SGP40
 Air quality 

 - detects: fire coal, natural gas emissions, cigarette/cooking smoke, emissions from construction activity, decoration material, furniture, and home appliances,
 
 0 ~ 1000 ppm ethanol equivalents

 - Communcation: I2C, address - 0x59

 - digital VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds)
