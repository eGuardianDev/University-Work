## UNIX 
Unix is standart.

## Linux
linux is a kernal. Software that lives close to the Hardware. A translater.


## POSIX
Portable Operating System Interface.

Standart. Maintains compatibility between diffrent os.

defines APIs, Shells and utility interfaces 

There are tests that need to be completed for an os to be POSIX complient. Example: 
- Standart C operations
- Multitasking
- Error States
- Command line & cmds


## POSIX is not Unix
SUS - Single Unix Specification

being SUS certified makes the os UNIX (its a payed fee)

## Why standarts
Compatability and expected functions
