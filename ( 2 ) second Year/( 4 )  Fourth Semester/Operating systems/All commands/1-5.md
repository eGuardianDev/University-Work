# 1 - basic intro

absolute route - /home/..../place

relative route - ../../dir1/file

- pwd - print working directory
- date
- cd - change directory
- ls - list
  - l - files in list (permissions, owner, etc.)
  - a - all (show hidden)

# 2 - working with files

- echo "print"
- echo -n "print without new line"

- cat - concat
- touch - create file
- tee - touch and write in files
- cp - copy
  - cp f1 f2 f3... fn dir - copy f1..fn into dir
- mv - move files
  - mv f1..fn dir
- mkdir - make directory
- rmdir - remove directory
- rm - remove file
  - rm -i - asks for deletion
  - rm -r - remove recursive

- file - file information
- wc - word count
  - -l - lines
  - -c - characters (bytes)
  - -w - words
  - default - displays lines, characters, words count
- head - gives first 10 rows of files
  - -{num}l - first {num} lines
  - -{num}c - first {num} characters
- tail - same as head but last insted of first
- more - shows screen by screen a file, left to right
- less - like more, but better navigation
- sort - sorts files by lines
  - -o - save output
- comm {f1} {f2} - compare files, collums, first for unique for f1 lines, second unique for f2 lines, third union
- diff - difference between files, how to change lines to be the same file
- cmp {f1} {f2} - compare files byte by byte
  - -s - returns true/false
- size - returns file size

## meta symbols
- ? - one symbols
- \* - zero or more
- [] - some from the brackets

[afs]* - contains a,f or s as first one
[a-z]* - contains a to z as first one

\\\? \\\* \\\>  escaping meta symbols

# 3 - streams

- cut - cuts(edits) files
  - -c {from-to} - specific symbols
  - -f - collums
  - -d - divider
- tr {set1} *{set2}* - edits **streams**. sets set1 to set2. if set1 is bigget than set2, set2 last is reperated
  - -d - remove all common with set1
  - -s - remove repeated from set1
- grep {str} {file}
  - -n - number of line
  - -h - hide name of file
  - -v - reverse
  - -q - true/false (exit code)
- find {dir to start search from} - searches **RECURSIVELY**. if only in current directory is needed use ```ls *.c``` for all .c files in current dir
  - -name
  - -type
  - -user
  - -group
  - -size - +25M more than 25 megabytes, -25M less than 25 megabytes (K - kilobytes, B - bytes...)
  - -exec - find / -name "*.txt" -exec wc -c {} \; - {} is changes with the found file, and ";" will ensure that is applied only once


## information

- ls
  - -l - long
  - -a - all
  - -r - reversed
  - -t - time created
  - -d - directories only
- cal {month} {year} - calendar
- du {file/dir} - disk usage
- df - disk information
- tty - name of file of current terminal
- who - user
    - -u - active users

# 4 - multiple users

## files permissions
- passwd - change password
- su - switch user
- chown - change owner
- chgrp - change group
- chmod - change mod [000-777]

```
chmod u=rw,og=r f1 -- user rw, other group repeated
chmod a+wx script.sh -- all wx
chmod go+w * - group other write
```
## users
- who - user information
    - -u - currenly logged
- whoami - login name
- w - currently logged in and what are doing
- users - only system user names
- finger - give info about user
- write {user} {tty} - send msg to user
- mesg {y/n} - dissable message receiving. if no argument is given, returns infromation about status of receiving 
- wall - write to all logged

## processes
- ps - all processes of currently logged user
    - -u - of specific user
    - -a - all users
    - -x - not connected to specific terminal
- kill {pid} - kills process
    - -9 - force kill process
- sleep - bash sleeps


# 5 - pipelining

- stdin - standart in 
- stdout - standart out 
- stderr - standart error

write user < data - standart in

```wc -c < f1``` vs ``` wc -f f1 ``` difference in output

```cat < f1``` == ```cat f1```

if f1 doesn't exist, cat reads from terminal

```ls, who, date``` ignore stdin

```cat > f1``` - creates and saves to f1. if file exists, it is overwriten.
```ps aux >> f1``` - if file exist it only concats to it.

```cat < f1 > f2```

```cd, chmod, kill``` - no stdout

stderr == ```2>``` or ```2>>``` - used in ```find``` to ignore permission denied


```&>``` - redirect stdout and stderr

## pipelining (конвейер)
- command1 | command2

## process starting
```man &``` - starts man in background when used ```&```, returns pid of process
