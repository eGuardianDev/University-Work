# Calculus 1 
I mainly studied for this course from proffesor's lectures, but there is one video I find very important to see (link below).

### get a good understanding

**Important** -> 3blue1brown's Calculus Youtube list - [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)

Not a lot of theory, just good explanations of main concepts
## Notes

### PDFs
[Коши, Ферма, Лагранж](http://info.fmi.shu-bg.net/skin/tfiles/vm2_010.pdf)

### Cheat sheets (to checkout [Don't cheat])
Personally I haven't used this. I found it like 3 minutes before this *git push*.
There is simple explanations, but in English -> [link](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)
Most of this things probably you won't see on test, but still good to have I guess. There are other sheets (like for Algebra), but there is nothing special there. *Still worth checking out.*
