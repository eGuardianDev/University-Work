Remember - it sounds more scary than what it is. Ask people in upper grade course for help, most people are willing to help.
Search wikipedia for more general introduction on specific topics.

### books and exercises
[Notes](https://www.book.store.bg/p349034/zapiski-po-algebra-linejna-algebra.html) - the topics are sligthly diffrent from what FMI introduces, but the diffrence can help you if you didn't understand it from the lectures.

[Exercises](https://www.book.store.bg/p288948/zadachi-po-algebra-linejna-algebra.html) - some exercises. Little too much, some can be very complex. Can be diffrent from what given in FMI. For best performance solve from the drives and notes of friends.
