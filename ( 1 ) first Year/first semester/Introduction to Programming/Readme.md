# Introduction to Programming
Not all files I worked with are here. (lost due to lack of archiving)
Please archive your projects and documents on sites like github or any other cloud. This is good way to build a portfolio and share with people you progress. 


### Why we learn c++?
This language is very low level compered to others like c# or python. This means that the programmer has more responsability for the memory the program use. You need to learn things like memory control, initlization and destruction (probably won't learn malloc and free) and C++ gives you simple tools to learn. Other languages like C#, Java or Golag have garbage collector. This tool takes care of the unused memory, but here this is your problem. **Warning!** Learning how memory works will help you a lot in the future, but it easy to "shoot yourself in the foot", because memory control can be confusing. Learning how everything works is very important for optimizations (Later introduces in Structures of data and Assembler courses [Computer Architecture - Practicum]).


### Introduction to concepts:

#### Dynamic memory
##### Pointers
Low level - What are points and how to read them: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ybLD6_2gKM) 

Dave's Garage - What are pointers and diffrent operations and properties: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrGjyfBC-u0)

##### Stack and Heap - unimportant

All of this channels have good introduction to many concepts and are worth checking out.
