### Some answears:

##### Why we learn so many math?
 - math is in the foundation of many computer concepts. You will learn how many things work and give you intuition for future ideas based on this concepts. Almost all subjects use old concepts and introduce something specific in their field. Algebra is in Geometry and AI, Geometry in Computer Graphic, Discrete math in Algorithms and Computer architectures.  
##### Why we learn theory?
 - theory gives you good formal idea for different parts of the subjects. Most of it won't be used in the wild. Computers have many libraries that solve Integrals, but understanding and using this theory can help you optimize systems and discover new ideas. (And if you want to get Phd you need it)
##### Things are too complex!
 - Here is some motivation. People will pay you to do complex stuff and when you graduate you will have amazing foundation to build uppon. I know it can be hard, but you got to here so you can do it!
##### Should I start work?
 - I know few people who work. Some of them couldn't keep the workload and didn't finish all their subjects. Some of them do very well. I and my friends think, the best to do it to take summer intership. Probably the best time to start working is during the final year of you study (or when you graduate).
##### I didn't pass all my exams, now what?
 - This is not the end of the world. You just have to retake them in the summer break. You can go to the next year with 3 unpassed subjects.
