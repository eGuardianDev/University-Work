# First year

### Some answears:

Why we learn so many math?
 - math is in the foundation of many computer concepts. You will learn how many things work and give you intuition for future ideas based on this concepts. Almost all subjects use old concepts and introduce something specific in their field. Algebra is in Geometry and AI, Geometry in Computer Graphic, Discrete math in Algorithms and Computer architectures.  
Why we learn theory?
 - theory gives you good formal idea for different parts of the subjects. Most of it won't be used in the wild. Computers have many libraries that solve Integrals, but understanding and using this theory can help you optimize systems and discover new ideas. (And if you want to get Phd you need it)
Things are too complex!
 - Here is so motivation. People will pay you to do complex stuff. When you graduate you will have amazing foundation to build uppon.
I didn't pass all my exams, now what?
 - This is not the end of the world. You just have to retake them in the summer break. You can go to the next year with 3 unpassed subjects
