# University Work (FMI 2023-....)
Most of the things I did in university and important information. Projects, notes, public PDF, etc. 

I will try to update this with new information that I find.

### Note about sources
Some lecures and documents have sensitive information or were requested to not be published anywhere.
Here you can see anything I create create and find publicly during my study in university.

### My advice:
- Finish you homework as early as you can
- Study before lectures to ask questions
- Make friends and (sometimes) study with them 
- Don't forget to take care of yourself
- Don't burnout
